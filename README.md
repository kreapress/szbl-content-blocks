Sizeable Content Blocks
=======================

Content Blocks is a free, GPL plugin for WordPress that provides a generic custom post
type with all supported features including:

* Title and Editor
* Attachments
* Hierarchies
* Featured Image
* Custom Fields
* Page Attributes

The plugin also contains two shortcodes (`szbl_content_block`, `szbl_content_blocks`)
and a basic widget for placing Content Blocks in your theme's sidebar.

This plugin works _great_ with Sizeable's [Content Tags](https://github.com/szbl/szbl-content-tags) plugin.

Installing Content Blocks
-------------------------

Simply upload the plugin folder to your `wp-content/plugins` folder and activate. You
will see the UI in your WordPress admin.

You can begin immediately by using shortcodes and the existing widget, or dive deeper
using our built-in function wrappers (`szbl_get_content_tag` and `szbl_get_content_tags`)
or do your own custom code using `WP_Query` or `get_posts()`.

Common Uses for Content Blocks
------------------------------

We often use Content Blocks at Sizeable Interactive for things that don't require a fully-customized
post type, or for small content that we aren't quite sure where to place, but that should be fully
managed by site admins.

We've used Content Blocks for:

* Slides (for custom home page sliders)
* Callout/Feature boxes on home pages
* Custom HTML widgets
* HTML for custom emails
* Biographies
* Miscellaneous content
